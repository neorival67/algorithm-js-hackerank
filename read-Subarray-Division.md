 ## Birthday Problem

This code solves the birthday problem, which asks: what is the probability that, in a group of n people, at least two of them have the same birthday?

The code uses a brute-force approach to solve the problem. It loops through all possible combinations of n people and checks if any two of them have the same birthday. If they do, the code increments a counter.

The function takes three arguments:

* `s`: An array of n integers, where each integer represents the birthday of a person in the group.
* `d`: The birth day that we are looking for.
* `m`: The number of people in the group.

The function returns the number of ways that we can choose m people from the group such that at least two of them have the same birthday.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

The code works as follows:

1. The function `birthday` is called with three arguments: `s`, `d`, and `m`.
2. The function initializes a variable `ans` to 0. This variable will store the number of ways that we can choose m people from the group such that at least two of them have the same birthday.
3. The function enters a loop that iterates from 0 to `s.length - m`. This loop iterates over all possible combinations of m people from the group.
4. Inside the loop, the function calculates the sum of the birthdays of the m people in the current combination.
5. If the sum of the birthdays is equal to `d`, then the function
