**Title: Rotate an Array to the Left**

## Explanation

**Description:**
This code defines a function called `rotLeft` that takes two arguments: an array `a` and an integer `d`. The function rotates the elements of the array `a` to the left by `d` positions.

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Creating a Copy of the Array:**
   - The first step is to create a copy of the original array `a` using the `slice()` method. This is done to avoid modifying the original array. The copied array is stored in a new variable called `newArr`.

2. **Looping for `d` Times:**
   - The function then enters a loop that iterates `d` times. This loop is responsible for rotating the elements of the array to the left.

3. **Rotating the Elements:**
   - Inside the loop, the first element of the `newArr` array is removed using the `shift()` method. This element is then appended to the end of the array using the `push()` method. This effectively rotates the elements of the array to the left by one position.

4. **Returning the Rotated Array:**
   - After the loop completes, the `newArr` array contains the rotated elements. This rotated array is then returned as the output of the `rotLeft` function.

**Example Usage:**
To use the `rotLeft` function, you can call it with the array and the number of positions to rotate as arguments. For example:

```javascript
const a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const d = 2;
const rotatedArray = rotLeft(a, d);
console.log(rotatedArray); // Output: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
```

In this example, the array `a` is rotated to the left by 2 positions, resulting in the output `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`.
